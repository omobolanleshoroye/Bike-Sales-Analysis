# Bike-Sales-Analysis
I analysed the product sales within a bicycle company using Microsoft Excel to gain key insights into the company's customers and potential customers. 

In this project, I performed Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and made use of Pivot tables. I concluded by creating a dashboard to visualise my findings.
